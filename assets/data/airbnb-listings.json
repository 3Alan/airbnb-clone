A unique space in an upmarket residential neighborhood, with all the luxuries of a 5-star Hotel, but with the privacy and feel of your own home.   This is how you can really feel what it's really like to live in Hong Kong, without all the hassles of dealing with the small details.\r\n\r\nFeel free to hit me up for recommendations or things to do.  I have a pretty wide range of suggestions from exclusive Michelin eats to roadside local experiences.  I also like to think I'm quite connected and up-to-date with what's going on locally, so I'm pretty sure I can get you what you need.  \r\n\r\nEnjoy your travels!",

    "neighborhood_overview": "This enigmatic city of skyscrapers, ancient traditions and heavenly food will fascinate, whether it's your first visit or your 50th. Culture Beyond the glass and steel of Hong Kong\u2019s commercial persona, the city also boasts a vibrant cultural scene that features the eclectic influences of its Chinese roots, colonial connections and a wondrous pool of homegrown talent. Here, you\u2019re just as likely to find yourself applauding at Asia\u2019s top film festival as joining in dawn taichi or reading the couplets of a local poet to the drumbeat of a dragon boat. Culture could also mean indie music under the stars, a classy art walk, your first Cantonese opera \u2013 not to mention the exhibitions and events staged year-round at the many museums and concert halls. Why I Love Hong Kong I love Hong Kong because it has a complexity that eludes definition, sometimes even by its own people. I can be soul-searching near the Chinese border, lunching with Sikhs at a Sikh temple, splurging on a set of kitchen kniv",
    "notes": "Please note that not every neighbor is happy about the New Sharing Economy. If we want them to understand the 21st century :-)) we should respect normal house rules like.... no party after 10pm, be quiet in the staircase/hallway, don't ring at neighbours bell because you cannot find the key in your handbag, don't throw things out of the window, eg. Just use your common sense.  Although the apartment is on a very high standard and equipped like a serviced apartment - I am still a private host but not a Hotel with fully employed staff and a front desk. Me and my team are always happy to assist - but if can take time to follow your not urgent request (like 1 more towel).",
    "transit": "By ferry The Kowloon waterfront at Tsim Sha Tsui Riding the Star Ferry from Central or Wan Chai ferry piers is considered a \"must-do\" for any traveller to Hong Kong. Not only is this the cheapest way to traverse the harbour, it's also the finest way to go sight-seeing, particularly at night, where you're surrounded by a wall of lights and skyscrapers on both sides. If you're feeling posh, you can pay fractionally more and travel as an upper-deck passenger. Alternatively, you can travel steerage and maybe get a glimpse into the noisy engine room. By train The Airport Express takes you to Kowloon MTR station in just 20 minutes. Most of Hong Kong's rail lines converge on Kowloon. If you are travelling from Hong Kong island, change at Admirality on the Island Line for the MTR to Tsim Sha Tsui from Hong Kong island. The MTR to Tsim Sha Tsui offers a faster service and is the most popular choice for commuters, so avoid Admiralty interchange during the rush hour (5 PM to 7 PM). Alternatively",
    "access": "The entire apartment with all amenities is accessible for my guests. All closets are empty but full of hangers, you will find toiletries and hair dryers in the bathrooms. the kitchen is fully equipped with pots, pans. china, glasses and cutlery. Basics like tea, coffee, water, milk, capsules for the Nespresso Machine are provided to make sure your arrival will be relaxed. Detergents for washing machine and dish washer are provided for a stay of 3 nights. My stand-by guest manager will happily provide more supplies on request for small additional costs.",
    "interaction": "I will respond to your questions within very short notice. My reservation team is online 24/7 and will always be able to assist in case I wouldn't be online.  I am online while using the following tools: airbnb thread, e-mail, (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN), phone, line, (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN). Let me know your preferred communication tool.",
    "house_rules": "Please... no party without acknowledgment and confirmation, no smoking but only on the balcony/ garden, no drugs, eg. Besides the risk of losing your deposit (apartment gets checked after your check out) it would be sad to lose the apartment due to inappropriate behaviour. Again - please use your common sense.",

Fa Yuen Street (2 blocks away) and Apliu Street (4 blocks away) markets are perfect for shoping fruits and vegetables and every other thing. Also there are a lot of restaurants and cafes around the area, including one of the best dim sum place (probably 30min waiting queue).",

Most Hong Kong listings have small windows or aren't high up enough to provide an open panoramic view.

    "neighborhood_overview": "Neighbourhood Goldfish Street, Fa Yuen Street Market, and the Flower Market are the neighbourhood attractions you'll find in your guide book. What's really special here are the alleys and walkways which connect them. Hong Kong is extremely dense, so the more niche shops have had to move to the second or third floors in walk-up buildings. That's where you'll find your python liquors and goggle-eyed camera repairmen. \u2606\u2606 Rich in markets and local cuisine \u2606\u2606 The cultural richness cuts across time and makes Prince Edward a trendy neighbourhood which keeps its traditional charm while skyscrapers are popping up everywhere. It's amazing just how many good Dim Sum (typical Cantonese dishes) restaurants are still around. There's even two Michelin starred restaurants within walking distance!",
    "notes": "Flat Entertainment  For the rainy days we have curated a selection of the finest works in Hong Kong cinema. Available upon request.  For longer stays you might want to switch things up a little. We have an extensive two-player board game collection. Available upon request.",
    "transit": "Getting Around Proximity to the MTR is everything in Hong Kong as trains depart every other minute and will take you to most places in under twenty. The Prince Edward MTR entrance is just outside our building, with the following travel times to popular destinations: \u2606\u2606 On top of the metro, very well connected \u2606\u2606 * Mong Kok (1 min) * Sham Shui Po (2 min) * Tsim Sha Tsui (10 min) * Central (15 min) * Wan Chai (15 min) * Causeway Bay (18 min) At night a taxi will take you back from popular nightlife hotspots LKF, Wan Chai, Knutsford terrace within 15 minutes and under HK 100. Prince Edward is also adjacent to the transportation hub of Mong Kok, so even when you're trying to get to the more remote temples and sights, there's literally no place in Hong Kong that isn't served by a bus or train from here.  A21 Bus HK 38 // Taxi HK 250   Airport arrivals are painless as the A21 Airport bus (50 minutes) stops just 250 meters from our place. A taxi would get you there in 30 minutes. In both",

There is a landscaped outdoor area on the second floor which doubles as the building's smoker hangout. * Please restrict pet action to the Gold Fish market downstairs.",

    "description": "You could not be better located, step out of the flat and you're in the heart of Soho which is full of art galleries, boutique shops, countless restaurant's and bars, massage spas etc.  The flat is quiet and comfortable for you to relax when needed. Central Hong Kong is full of old Chinese walk up buildings bursting with character like this one and you will get a feeling of what it's like to live here as a local.  With a Shop selling local art and a lingerie shop on the first two floors you'll get to do a bit of window shopping as you walk up to the flat on the 4th floor.  The living room is a bright space with a comfortable sofa, 42\" TV and lots of books (including guides to HK) for you to read.  On the wall you'll find photographs I've taken whilst traveling around the world.  The table for two overlooks Hollywood Road and is a great place to people watch both day and night.  The bathroom is very small and there is a small open kitchen with a double hob, microwave oven which can stea",

    "neighborhood_overview": "I love to continually learn about the history of HK which I find fascinating.  Hollywood Road was the first road to be completed in HK in 1844 and the road and streets off it are full of history.  I find that so many of the people, both local and expats are incredibly busy here rushing around so don't always have their eyes fully open.  As a tourist you have time to appreciate the area fully.  Pak Tsz Lane Park is very close by just off Hollywood Rd and is one my favourite little places tucked away. Man Mo Temple and Aesop Park are further down Hollywood Road towards Sheung Wan.  I have a book on the shelf for historical walks in the area for anybody to look at if interested.  Whatever you are looking for in HK it's on your doorstep here and it's a great area to walk around.",
    "notes": "You have all the bars and restaurant's of Soho on your doorstep and LKF is 200m away but the flat is surprisingly quiet.  The bathroom in the flat is very small as it's an old building. There is a small open kitchen.  The flat is a 4th floor walk up in case you have an aversion to stairs.",

As this is a family business, please try your best to arrive at the apartment as early as possible. After 11:30pm as transport to the apartment is limited for us, we have to charge HKD150 to cover our taxi transport cost to and from the apartment. We are generally exhausted at the end of the day and we really would rather you arrive early and not have to charge this. Guests must wait for us OUTSIDE the building upon arrival and not enter the building without us as this causes unnecessary misunders",

    "neighborhood_overview": "Central (also Central District; Chinese: \u4e2d\u74b0) is the central business district of Hong Kong. It is located in Central and Western District, on the north shore of Hong Kong Island, across Victoria Harbour from Tsim Sha Tsui, the southernmost point of Kowloon Peninsula. The area was the heart of Victoria City, although that name is rarely used today. As the central business district of Hong Kong, it is the area where many multinational financial services corporations have their headquarters. Consulates general and consulates of many countries are also located in this area, as is Government Hill, the site of the government headquarters. The area, with its proximity to Victoria Harbour, has served as the centre of trade and financial activities from the earliest days of the British colonial era in 1841, and continues to flourish and serve as the place of administration after the transfer of sovereignty to China in 1997. The Soho (Chinese: \u8607\u8c6a; also \u8377\u5357 and \u8377\u5357\u7f8e\u98df\u5340; formally \u4e2d\u74b0\u8607\u8c6a\u5340) district in H",

Make sure to contact us by phone at least 30 minutes prior to arrival such that we can meet you at the flat to hand you the keys and acquaint you to the surroundings.  As this is a family business, please try your best to arrive at the apartment as early as possible. After 11:30pm as transport to the apartment is limited for us, we have to charge HKD100 to cover our taxi transport cost to and from the apartment. We are generally exhausted at the end of the day and we really would rather you arrive early and not have to charge this. Guests must wait for us OUTSIDE the building upon arrival and not enter the building without us as this causes unnecessary misunders",

This is how you can really feel what it's really like to live in Hong Kong, without all the hassles of dealing with the small details.\r\n\r\nFeel free to hit me up for recommendations or things to do.  I have a pretty wide range of suggestions from exclusive Michelin eats to roadside local experiences.  I also like to think I'm quite connected and up-to-date with what's going on locally, so I'm pretty sure I can get you what you need.  \r\n\r\nEnjoy your travels!",

This influx of people and money has resulted in new cool bars, bistros, restaurants, independent businesses etc. opening up to compliment the well established local businesses that have been trading here for years and still thriving today.

    "interaction": "When I'm around and mood/schedule dependent i'll be as involved or elusive as you like i.e. we could be passing ships in the night, boozy and laughing on the terrace, chilling with a movie and take away or poss out on the town if we so wish. lets just take it as it comes with no commitments or expectations. Cecile is my helper. She works 8am-7pm Mon-Fri and \u00bd day Saturday and lives out of the apartment. Essentially she is there to look after Albert and the household upkeep while I\u2019m at work or out playing so she will sporadically pop in and out throughout the day to clean the whole apartment, walk the dog, laundry etc Albert is my 6 year old  Beaglier (cross Beagle/Cavalier) which means he is very intelligent (Beagle) and very charming (Cavalier). The house is his domain however keep your room door shut when you leave to avoid any kleptomania (he has form lol). Finally, never feed him, oh, and do expect to be randomly sniffed, licked and harassed to play fetch!",
    "house_rules": "Don't feed Albert (my dog) but pat and play with him :-) Always press the lock on the main entrance interior door when you leave. No smoking in the house but on either terrace is absolutely fine* no cigarettes to be thrown over the side, please use ash tray provided. No random overnight guests *willing to discuss up front if you have friends in town who want to visit on a case by case basis. The helper Cecile is employed by me and I\u2019m happy to discuss how/where/when she can help you however direction/instruction must come from me except if you want her to do laundry and you just arrange with her directly. Anything else can be discussed and agreed before booking.",

    "house_rules": "For the duration of your stay, this is your home, you are welcome to treat it as such. You are welcome to do what you like but I ask that, like your own home, you treat it with respect. If anything gets broken or has any lasting damage, all I ask that you let me know. The same goes if you plan to take something from the apartment, just let me know, I'm sure we can come to an arrangement. Other than that you are free to do as you like and act how you would in your own home. I wholly encourage pets of all shapes and sizes as long as their owners are caring and responsible with them  As for smoking, there's an ash tray that gets cleaned out every day, in the stairwell right by the elevator. If you just have to smoke inside the unit, please leave a window open. And never ever smoke in bed, but that is more a rule of life than for this house.",

After graduate, I worked one year in United States, and then came back to Shanghai and work as a senior R&D Engineer in a world's fortune 500 company. \r\n\r\nI love science and math, and also love travelling and hosting! In my spare time, I host guests with extra apartments. I am happy to make friends with guests from all over the world. \r\n\r\nMy apartments are located in Sheung Wan and Central area, which is the best spot for travelers in Hong Kong Island! It is just walk distance of 2 minutes to Sheung Wan MTR, 1 min to bus stop, 5 min to ferry, 10 min to Lan Kwai Fong and SOHO area (elevator to mid-level)! They are also very quiet compared with general big city accommodations, because they face the quiet and small streets and, so there is no need to worry about big city noise and just enjoy you night time and good sleep! The price is also unbeatable compared with the other flats in the same location.\r\n\r\nI am flexible and easy communicate with. My assistant is very nice and considerate, and also hard-work. She will do the cleaning and organize the apt for you before you check in. Either me or her will bring you in the apt. When you check out, please just leave the keys on the table. If there is anything else that we could do better for you, please don't hesitate to let us know! We will be glad to be helpful during you stay in Hong Kong!",

    "house_rules": "This is a Strictly NON SMOKING Flat. UPON ARRIVAL AT PROPERTY, ALL GUESTS MUST WAIT FOR ME AT THE FRONT GATE OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING.  BUILDING RESIDENTS WILL COMPLAIN TO PROPERTY MANAGEMENT IF THE LOBBY AREA INSIDE BUILDING IS BLOCKED.  THANKS FOR YOUR KIND UNDERSTANDING FOR AN ENJOYABLE STAY. Check in time is AFTER 12:30 pm.  Make sure to contact us by phone at least 30 minutes prior to arrival such that we can meet you at the flat to hand you the keys and acquaint you to the surroundings.  As this is a family business, please try your best to arrive at the apartment as early as possible. After 11:30pm as transport to the apartment is limited for us, we have to charge HKD150 to cover our taxi transport cost to and from the apartment. We are generally exhausted at the end of the day and we really would rather you arrive early and not have to charge this. Guests must wait for us OUTSIDE the building upon arrival and not enter the building without us as this causes unnecessary misunders",

    "host_about": "Hello everyone on Airbnb! My goal is to have my footprints in all the countries in the world. (How big a goal it is!) I have been to Australia, the UK, Italy, France, Monaco, Holland and Korea for travelling, and to the US, China, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Cambodia mainly for work. I lived in China, Thailand and Mexico for years and now living in my hometown Hong Kong. I enjoy every single moment travelling from one place to another. It's the best time for me to overlook the world and to empty my mind. It is said that the world is becoming smaller and smaller. We are on the southern hemisphere in the morning and appear on the northern in just some hours. The best way for me to feel home anywhere is to meet local people! I listen to their stories and learn their cultures, respect their traditions and share mine with them. This is what travelling means to me.\r\n\r\nThanks to Airbnb, it provides a platform for people to meet friends and look for accommodation at reasonable price. Star-rated hotels are great, but local hosts can give you warm welcome and make you feel home.\r\n\r\nI have years of experience hosting foreign guests through couhcsrufnig (CS), but stopped hosting since 2 years ago. After I returned from Mexico to Hong Kong in 2014 to start this hotel business, I found that airbnb is one of the best platforms which combines couhcsrufnig and business into one. Look forward to seeing you, my new friend!",

If you are sensitive to noise, this place isn't for you. Sorry. 2. Normally, cooking and alcohol are prohibited. 3. Check out time 1pm. I'll try to accommodate to your situation. The most current guest's interests must be protected. 4. Water heater needs to be turned off when not using. If it breaks due to prolonged time left on, you will not have any hot water for your stay and will be subject to expensive repair charges.",

Home to lots of young professionals. 5-minute walk to lots of art galleries, bars, restaurants, coffee shops. 10-minute walk to one of the best Western-style supermarkets in Hong Kong.",
    "notes": "If you dislike anything it will likely be the shower situation and the overall apartment size, both of which are common in less expensive Hong Kong apartments: No separate shower stall and you need to flip a switch to heat up the shower's water in advance. Water stays hot for about 5 minutes, so I always turn it on and off throughout each shower to maintain the heat. Apartment is 150 square feet/14 square meters but it feels bigger due to efficient layout. In security features, the building has a 24-hour onsite security guard and an iron front gate that locks at night. ***The cleaning fee includes the cost of laundering winter bedding.***",

My friend who is native bilingual in Mandarin and English and lives and works a short walk away is your onsite contact, but I'm happy to message you before and during your stay. I strive to, from afar, make my apartment easy to get to and stay at. \n\nMy life motto is the chorus of the musical Caberet's title song:\r\nWhat good is sitting alone in your room?\r\nCome here the music play.\r\nLife is a cabaret, old chum!\r\nCome to the cabaret.\n\n\u6211\u4e0a\u5927\u5b66\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u5b66\u4e86\u7b80\u4f53\u5b57\u548c\u666e\u901a\u8bdd\u7136\u540e2008\u5e74-2010\u5e74\u5728\u5317\u4eac\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e86\u3002",

This is a place that the Tourism Board seldom introduce but it is a special experience living here.  It is not occupied by chain stores and brand names.  Things are cheap and stores and hawkers are operated by the owner themselves and this means more human interactions. The Ap Liu Street, for example, is famous for electronic products and second-hand products, while the Golden Shopping Center for computer products.  Ladies will find the Pei Ho Street area interesting as there are clothes and fashion accessories selling at cheap prices. And of course there are local delicacies.",
    "notes": "The calendar is correct.  It is what-you-see-is-what-you-get. For bookings of less than 3 nights please do within one week. I will not agree to any invitation to deal without going through the system, and also no bargain please. For an exchange arrangement please ask.",
    "transit": "The place is close to MTR stations.  There are bus stops downstairs taking you to many places.  I especially recommend the bus no. 2 which goes to Tsim Sha Tsui Ferry Pier.  Try the ice-cream car and take ferry to the island side.  The Victoria Harbor view is great, and is different during the day and the night.  Bus no. 2 will pass through Price Edward, Mongkok, Jordan and you can visit these places too.  Get off at Jordan to the Temple Street at night, have dinner there, have fun.",

Don't really use hotel much as they are almost the same interior.  But always love the hotel resort in Bali or Phuket with Spa facilities.  Never too much to pamper myself all day long :-)\r\n\r\nDue to the reason that Sep-Apr is peak season, you are advised to make your reservation earlier.   I can only do first book first serve basis, where I won't cancel current booking just because other guests have a longer / bigger booking.  Due to strict cancellation policy, I haven't got any booking cancellation so far).\r\n\r\nMax Capacity is cater to big group consists of family n kids with standard asian size.  If group with members with huge body size or some members prefer to have a solid bed by their own, not sharing with other, then please split your group into two apartments for more comfortable stay.  I have tried my best to write the apartment description as detail as I could. Please spend time to read through before you book.  I am definitely happy to answer any question that is not in the apartment description.\r\n\r\nThank you and have a nice day.\r\n\r\nGlad to have over 380 guests who left me reviews!!  Work so hard to keep happy guests but only 20% of guests spend their precious time to write reviews :-)  CHEERS to all supportive new guests, return guests and referred guests.  I hope to serve you better.  Please do give us private feedback anytime and I valued your feedback and will improve my apartments.  I am so glad many of you appreciate all the hard work and bare with the occasionally 1% silly mistake / fault / defect I have made.  Thank you so much for your patient.  \r\n\r\nAgain, should you need anything during your stay, don't be shy, please do let me know via calling or email me.  I am more than happy to provide suggestion / immediate assistant / support as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\r\nFOR NEW airbnb user, below are some of the FAQ links for your perusal (questions & answers useful for new user). Please do let me know if you have any problem, my response would be faster than airbnb support team as sometimes their hotline as very busy (but I only can help you on general question).\r\n\r\nGENERAL FAQ for guests before booking \r\nwww.airbnb.com/help/topic/traveling\r\n\r\nFAQ: What are Airbnb Service Fees? \r\nwww.airbnb.com/help/question/104\r\n\r\nFAQ: For How to Book \r\nwww.airbnb.com/help/question/85\r\n\r\nFAQ: For How to make a payment / reservation \r\nwww.airbnb.com/help/question/126\r\n\r\nFAQ: For How to Contact Airbnb Support \r\nwww.airbnb.com/help/question/9\r\n\r\nFAQ: How and when do I make a payment for my reservation? \r\nwww.airbnb.com/help/question/92\r\n\r\nFAQ: How can I view or print a billing receipt or itinerary for my trip? \r\nwww.airbnb.com/help/question/100\r\n\r\nFAQ: How are cleaning fees added? \r\nwww.airbnb.com/help/question/58\r\n\r\nFAQ: How does the Airbnb payment system work? \r\nwww.airbnb.com/help/question/51\r\n\r\nWe strongly recommend reviewing all cancellation policies before making your reservations: www.airbnb.com/home/cancellation_policies\r\n\r\nFAQ: When do I pay for my long-term reservation?\r\nwww.airbnb.com/help/question/245\r\n\r\nContact Number and Email Information will only be released until a booking is made. \r\n\r\nBelow is the FAQ on airbnb \u201cWhy can\u2019t I call or email a host before booking?\u201d: www.airbnb.com/help/question/111\r\n\r\nHope this helps you get to know how airbnb works :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\r\nFor Pricing, at the listing page, enter check in date, check out date and total number of guests.  The system will auto generate the price for your consideration.  Regarding the currency display, it depends on your own setting, you can change your currency setting at the lower left panel of your airbnb page under the \"LANGUAGE\", you will see \"CURRENCY\" setting.  Just click on it to change to any currency that you wish to display.\r\n\r\nThe listing page only able to display DEFAULT DAILY, WEEKLY and MONTHLY rate that only applies to dates that I did not input any VARIABLE price.  FYI, I will normally enter the VARIABLE price 6 to 8 months ahead.  For example, MAR, I will UPDATE variable price for OCT - DEC end of the year, JUN I will UPDATE variable price MAR next year (especially 3rd and 4th week of MAR is always FULL HOUSE due to Ruby Seven Event), and  JAN, I will UPDATE variable price for JUN-SEPT etc.  So if now is DEC 2014, if you book next year DEC 2015, for sure you will get default rate serving as EARLY BIRD discount.\r\n\r\nThe Weekly price (10% discount from daily rate) applies for booking over 7 nights only and Monthly price (20% discount from daily rate)  applies for booking 28 nights or more. The Additional Guests Fee applies to all booking at daily/weekly/monthly rate (US10-30 per night per guest beyond 1-3 guests depends on the size & number of room of each listing). The Additional Guest Fee covers extra cleaning/extra mattress setting/clean sheet/clean towel/extra electricity/water, extra wear and tear incurred.  The Cleaning Fee charges cover cleaning before and after your stay.  For Extra Cleaning during your stay, General House-Keeping is HK80 per hour.  If you want FULL CLEANING that included new sheets and towel replacement would the same with the Initial Cleaning Fee per visit.",
