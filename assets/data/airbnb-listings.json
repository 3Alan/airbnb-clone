A unique space in an upmarket residential neighborhood, with all the luxuries of a 5-star Hotel, but with the privacy and feel of your own home.   This is how you can really feel what it's really like to live in Hong Kong, without all the hassles of dealing with the small details.\r\n\r\nFeel free to hit me up for recommendations or things to do.  I have a pretty wide range of suggestions from exclusive Michelin eats to roadside local experiences.  I also like to think I'm quite connected and up-to-date with what's going on locally, so I'm pretty sure I can get you what you need.  \r\n\r\nEnjoy your travels!",

    "neighborhood_overview": "This enigmatic city of skyscrapers, ancient traditions and heavenly food will fascinate, whether it's your first visit or your 50th. Culture Beyond the glass and steel of Hong Kong\u2019s commercial persona, the city also boasts a vibrant cultural scene that features the eclectic influences of its Chinese roots, colonial connections and a wondrous pool of homegrown talent. Here, you\u2019re just as likely to find yourself applauding at Asia\u2019s top film festival as joining in dawn taichi or reading the couplets of a local poet to the drumbeat of a dragon boat. Culture could also mean indie music under the stars, a classy art walk, your first Cantonese opera \u2013 not to mention the exhibitions and events staged year-round at the many museums and concert halls. Why I Love Hong Kong I love Hong Kong because it has a complexity that eludes definition, sometimes even by its own people. I can be soul-searching near the Chinese border, lunching with Sikhs at a Sikh temple, splurging on a set of kitchen kniv",
    "notes": "Please note that not every neighbor is happy about the New Sharing Economy. If we want them to understand the 21st century :-)) we should respect normal house rules like.... no party after 10pm, be quiet in the staircase/hallway, don't ring at neighbours bell because you cannot find the key in your handbag, don't throw things out of the window, eg. Just use your common sense.  Although the apartment is on a very high standard and equipped like a serviced apartment - I am still a private host but not a Hotel with fully employed staff and a front desk. Me and my team are always happy to assist - but if can take time to follow your not urgent request (like 1 more towel).",
    "transit": "By ferry The Kowloon waterfront at Tsim Sha Tsui Riding the Star Ferry from Central or Wan Chai ferry piers is considered a \"must-do\" for any traveller to Hong Kong. Not only is this the cheapest way to traverse the harbour, it's also the finest way to go sight-seeing, particularly at night, where you're surrounded by a wall of lights and skyscrapers on both sides. If you're feeling posh, you can pay fractionally more and travel as an upper-deck passenger. Alternatively, you can travel steerage and maybe get a glimpse into the noisy engine room. By train The Airport Express takes you to Kowloon MTR station in just 20 minutes. Most of Hong Kong's rail lines converge on Kowloon. If you are travelling from Hong Kong island, change at Admirality on the Island Line for the MTR to Tsim Sha Tsui from Hong Kong island. The MTR to Tsim Sha Tsui offers a faster service and is the most popular choice for commuters, so avoid Admiralty interchange during the rush hour (5 PM to 7 PM). Alternatively",
    "access": "The entire apartment with all amenities is accessible for my guests. All closets are empty but full of hangers, you will find toiletries and hair dryers in the bathrooms. the kitchen is fully equipped with pots, pans. china, glasses and cutlery. Basics like tea, coffee, water, milk, capsules for the Nespresso Machine are provided to make sure your arrival will be relaxed. Detergents for washing machine and dish washer are provided for a stay of 3 nights. My stand-by guest manager will happily provide more supplies on request for small additional costs.",
    "interaction": "I will respond to your questions within very short notice. My reservation team is online 24/7 and will always be able to assist in case I wouldn't be online.  I am online while using the following tools: airbnb thread, e-mail, (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN), phone, line, (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN). Let me know your preferred communication tool.",
    "house_rules": "Please... no party without acknowledgment and confirmation, no smoking but only on the balcony/ garden, no drugs, eg. Besides the risk of losing your deposit (apartment gets checked after your check out) it would be sad to lose the apartment due to inappropriate behaviour. Again - please use your common sense.",
